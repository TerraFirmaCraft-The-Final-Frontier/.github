### TFC:TFF is a Minecraft x TerraFirmaCraft total overhaul progression focused modpack project.
- TFC:TFF is still heavily under development.
- Feel free to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/EeGWgbwwrJ) to learn more!
- If you'd rather, you can instead [add Lylythii#0001 on Discord](https://discord.com/users/857969485670383647) & ask questions more directly!
- If you'd like to contribute to the project. Let us know!

This organisation is dedicated to most-everything associated with TFC:TFF. It holds the custom/maintained forks & mods used within the project.

In the future, community created content, tools, & accessibility options will be found on [this GitHub organisation](https://github.com/TFCTFF).

Some, but not all, mods included here can be used stand-alone or in other modded environments. Whilst others will not work outside the TFC:TFF modpack environment & will heavily depend on TFC:TFF (the mod) to be present.

# Summary of the project:
*pending...*

# Installation:
TFF (the modpack) has a rather unique installation, unlike all other modpacks out there! Installation is as simple as dropping a single mod & configuration file into your Minecraft instance. This also means TFF is modpack launcher agnostic! It can be installed anywhere.

Pick your favourite launcher, be it CurseForge, PrismLauncher, ATLauncher, GDLauncher, MultiMC, Technic, Vanilla, or otherwise... Create a new 1.12.2 Forge profile, & away you go! TFF will handle the installation, configuration, patching *& even updating!* of everything all by itself!

This also makes TFF the first modpack of its kind, & a modpack that will never need to be given future updates on distribution sites such as CurseForge, Modrinth or GitHub! (We will provide a single ready-to-use modpack instance on those sites, if you'd rather download it from those distributors.)

# Downloads
- (These don't work yet, in the future we'll provide simple *ready-to-install* or *drag-&-drop* instances for you!)
### Drag-&-Drop releases can be dropped into any valid 1.12.2 Forge modpack instance. Launcher specific instances will generally only work on those launchers or compatible launchers.
- [CurseForge Instance!]()
- [Modrinth Instance!]()
- [PrismLauncher/MultiMC/similar Instance!]()
- [Technic Launcher Instance!]()
- [GDLauncher Instance!]()
- [ATLauncher Instance!]()
- [GitHub Drag-&-Drop Release!]()
- [Discord Drag-&-Drop Release!]()
# Archives
### Created for the purpose of project archival. We feel archival is an important thing!
### For this reason also, we keep private archives of the modpacks version history, that are allowed to be sent to GitHub's own Arctic Code Vault.
- [Archive.org Drag-&-Drop Release!]()
- [Archive.org (Archival Purpose) releases-with-disabled-updaters]()
- [GitHub Archives]()

# Planned
- Custom Launcher for installing the project.
